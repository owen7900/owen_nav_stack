## My simple Nav Stack
This is my simple nav stack for an iRobot Create2.

Over time, I plan to re-implement most 3rd party nodes and systems myself as programming exercises

This now works with slam

TODO
- Add self-docking feature
- Add people (or pet) following
- Add vacuum path generation
- Change gridmap to quadtree (or just add a quadtree map implementation)
- Implement my own localization?
    - SLAM?
    - UKF?
    - Particle Filter?
